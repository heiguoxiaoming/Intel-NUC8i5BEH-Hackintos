* __I am hard to change the card reader and cannot use the card reader__
* __Type-C's lightning cannot be used, but can only be used as a full-featured Type-C__

### System related
- Windows and macOS time are not synchronized

-Open the command line in Windows and enter Reg add HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\TimeZoneInformation /v RealTimeIsUniversal /t REG_DWORD /d 1

-Restart to macOS, synchronize the time on the Internet, and enter Windows again to display the time normally

### Instructions for use
-The default AirportItlwm is the Catalina version, please replace it if necessary

- BIOS settings
  - Devices -> USB -> Port Device Charging Mode: off
  - Devices -> USB -> USB Legacy -> Disabled
  - Security -> Thunderbolt Security Level: Legacy Mode
  - Power -> Wake on LAN from S4/S5: Stay Off
  - Boot -> Boot Configuration -> Network Boot: Disable

- Use [GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS) to generate MLB SystemSerialNumber

- Obtain SystemUUID in Win. Enter wmic at the command prompt and then enter csproduct or csproduct list full

- Use following command to build the EFI.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TokiharaSay/Intel-NUC8i5BEH-Hackintos
cd Intel-NUC8i5BEH-Hackintos
chmod +x **/*.sh
./build.sh
```

Find generated EFI under `Output` folder. Find OpenCore config at `Output/EFI/OC/config_sample.plist` and fill in your own SMBIOS (Follow [the guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/iservices.html), use  `model you need`) then rename `config_sample.plist` to `config.plist`.


### Thanks for the help of the following friends

- OpenCore technology exchange group, group friends solve thunder and lightning (no files are provided because they are not perfect)
